# Wave Interference Simulation

A Svelte and WebGL-based interactive wave interference simulation. Drag wave sources on a canvas to visualize real-time interference patterns. Adjust wavelength, frequency, amplitude decay, and dot density. Mobile-friendly with touch support.

## Features
- Real-time wave interference visualization using WebGL.
- Drag two colored sources (red, blue) to explore patterns.
- Adjust per-source wavelength (10–150 px) and frequency (0.1–2 Hz).
- Global controls for amplitude decay (0–2) and dot density (0.1–3).
- Responsive layout: controls stack vertically on mobile.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xdarkcap/wave-simulation.git
   cd wave-simulation
   npm install
   npm run dev
  ```
